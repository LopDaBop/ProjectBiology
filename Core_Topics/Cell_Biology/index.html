    <h1>Cell Biology</h1>
    <h2>Cell Theory</h2>
    <p>All living organisms are composed of one or more cells; the cell is the basic unit of life; all cells arise from pre-existing cells.</p>
    <h2>Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells</h2>
    <p>Differences in structure and function.</p>
    <h2>Key Organelles</h2>
    <p>Functions of the nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and chloroplasts.</p>
    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    <p>Stem cell therapy, genetic engineering (CRISPR), cancer research, and vaccine development.</p>
    <h2>Cell Structure and Function</h2>
    <p>Cells are the basic unit of life, and they come in two main types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are simpler and do not have a nucleus, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and organelles. Understanding the structure of cells is crucial for grasping how they function.</p>
    <p>Key organelles include the nucleus, which houses DNA; mitochondria, known as the powerhouse of the cell; ribosomes, which synthesize proteins; and the endoplasmic reticulum, which helps in the synthesis of proteins and lipids.</p>
    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    <p>Cell biology has numerous applications in medicine and biotechnology. For instance, stem cell therapy is a groundbreaking approach to treating various diseases, including cancer and degenerative conditions. Genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR, allow scientists to modify genes, offering potential cures for genetic disorders.</p>
    <h2>Case Study: CRISPR Gene Editing</h2>
    <p>CRISPR technology has revolutionized genetic research by allowing precise edits to DNA. This technique has applications in agriculture, where it can be used to create crops that are resistant to pests, as well as in medicine, where it holds promise for treating genetic diseases.</p>
    <h2>Effective Study Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilize flashcards to memorize key terms and organelle functions.</li>
        <li>Engage in group discussions to deepen understanding of complex topics.</li>
        <li>Practice drawing and labeling diagrams of cell structures.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Mastering cell biology is essential for success in IB Biology. Focus on understanding the structure and function of cells, and how these concepts apply to real-world scenarios.</p>
    <h2>Additional Study Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use diagrams to visualize cell structures.</li>
        <li>Practice with past IB exam questions.</li>
        <li>Join study groups to discuss concepts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
